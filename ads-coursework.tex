\section{Introduction}

The aim of this report is to explore and compare the different properties of
three different kinds of databases beyond the traditional relational model. In it,
the same dataset will be modelled in each of an \emph{Object-Relational} database,
an \emph{XML} database and a \emph{Document} database.

An optimal structure or schema will be designed for each database type, then
each design will be implemented in each of \emph{PostgreSQL}, \emph{eXist}
and \emph{MongoDB} along with a discussion around how each database would be
queried for different use cases.

Finally, there will be a comparitive discussion around the advantages and
disadvantages between the different database types, including which the use
cases to which each kind of database are most appropriate.
